# NerdTechPack
Minecraft Forge modpack for 1.18.2, with focus on mod interactions. Made for Modrinth

Main Principles:
Tech - High with focus on intra mod compatibility and interactions

Magic - Low, vanilla plus style (enchantments etc.)

Interactions - Mods should be able to be used in conjunction. For example you might use Bigger reactors's Reactor to generate Steam, which you might use in Advanced Turbines, which generates Forge Energy, which is used by motor to generate Create's rotational energy, that is used in a Compressor to generate Pneumaticcraft's pressure. Yes, that is one of the possible aplications with the mods in this modpack. 

Thank you to Direwolf20 modpack team for RS and AE2 JEI Hiding scripts.
Thank you to the FTB Team for FTB Interactions modpack which serves as inspiration
Thank you to the Enigmatica team for Enigmatica Expert modpacks which serve as inspiration
Thank you to mathgeniuszach for the UnifyTags sctipts which are the unification scripts I use
